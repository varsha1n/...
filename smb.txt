1.The Protocol: The folder is "broadcasted" over the company network using a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows or NFS (Network File System) for Linux.

How SMB Works (The Basics)
SMB operates on a Client-Server model.

The Client (your computer) sends a request to access a file or printer.

The Server (the file share or device) verifies your identity and permissions.

The Connection stays open so you can read, edit, or delete files as if they were physically on your own hard drive.


2.The Mapping: * Users see it as a "Network Drive" (like the S: Drive).

The Watcher Script (on the Server) sees it as a "Mounted Path" (like //file-server/uploads)via a network path.

| **Location of File**                    | **Path Used by User**                  | **Path Used by Watcher Script**            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical Disk**                       | `D:\Data\Uploads` (on the File Server) | N/A                                        |
| **User’s View (Mapped Drive)**          | `S:\Uploads`                           | N/A                                        |
| **Watcher’s View (Server Access Path)** | N/A                                    | `/mnt/shared/uploads` or `\\Files\Uploads` |


		
3. The Logical Flow
The data doesn't "jump" directly to the database. It moves through these "stations":

Station 1 (The Shared Folder): The file sits here. It is just a static piece of data on a hard drive.

Station 2 (The Watcher): Every 5 minutes, the Watcher script "knocks on the door" of the Shared Folder via the network. It asks the File Server: "Is there anything new?"

Station 3 (The API Call): Once the Watcher finds a file, it pulls that data across the network into its own memory and uploads it to the Worker API.

| **Step**      | **Action**                       | **Technology**       | **What’s happening**                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingest**    | User drops file in `S:\uploads\` | SMB Protocol         | The Excel file is written to shared network storage.                  |
| **Watch**     | Watcher scans the path           | `os.listdir()`       | Every 5 minutes, the script detects new Excel files.                  |
| **Process**   | Script converts file             | `watcher_script.py`  | The Excel data is converted into `.lr` (comma-separated text) format. |
| **API Call**  | Watcher sends `.lr` data         | HTTP POST            | The script sends the `.lr` file content to the Database API.          |
| **Upload**    | API writes data to DB            | SQL `INSERT`         | The server stores the `.lr` content permanently in database tables.   |
| **Next File** | Watcher waits for API response   | HTTP Response Object | The script receives `HTTP 200 Success` and proceeds to the next file. |
