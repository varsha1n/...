1.The Protocol: The folder is "broadcasted" over the company network using a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows or NFS (Network File System) for Linux.

How SMB Works (The Basics)
SMB operates on a Client-Server model.

The Client (your computer) sends a request to access a file or printer.

The Server (the file share or device) verifies your identity and permissions.

The Connection stays open so you can read, edit, or delete files as if they were physically on your own hard drive.


2.The Mapping: * Users see it as a "Network Drive" (like the S: Drive).

The Watcher Script (on the Server) sees it as a "Mounted Path" (like //file-server/uploads)via a network path.



		
3. The Logical Flow
The data doesn't "jump" directly to the database. It moves through these "stations":

Station 1 (The Shared Folder): The file sits here. It is just a static piece of data on a hard drive.

Station 2 (The Watcher): Every 5 minutes, the Watcher script "knocks on the door" of the Shared Folder via the network. It asks the File Server: "Is there anything new?"

Station 3 (The API Call): Once the Watcher finds a file, it pulls that data across the network into its own memory and uploads it to the Worker API.
