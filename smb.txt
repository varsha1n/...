1.The Protocol: The folder is "broadcasted" over the company network using a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows or NFS (Network File System) for Linux.

How SMB Works (The Basics)
SMB operates on a Client-Server model.

The Client (your computer) sends a request to access a file or printer.

The Server (the file share or device) verifies your identity and permissions.

The Connection stays open so you can read, edit, or delete files as if they were physically on your own hard drive.


2.The Mapping: * Users see it as a "Network Drive" (like the S: Drive).

The Watcher Script (on the Server) sees it as a "Mounted Path" (like //file-server/uploads)via a network path.

Location of File	Path Used by User	Path Used by Watcher Script
Physical Disk	D:\Data\Uploads (on the File Server)	N/A
User's View	S:\Uploads	N/A
Watcher's View	N/A	/mnt/shared/uploads or \\Files\Uploads


		
3. The Logical Flow
The data doesn't "jump" directly to the database. It moves through these "stations":

Station 1 (The Shared Folder): The file sits here. It is just a static piece of data on a hard drive.

Station 2 (The Watcher): Every 5 minutes, the Watcher script "knocks on the door" of the Shared Folder via the network. It asks the File Server: "Is there anything new?"

Station 3 (The API Call): Once the Watcher finds a file, it pulls that data across the network into its own memory and uploads it to the Worker API.


Step	Action	Technology	What's happening?
Ingest	User drops file in S:\	SMB Protocol	The file is written to the network storage.
Watch	Watcher scans the path	os.listdir()	Every 5 mins, the script finds the new Excel file.
Process	Script runs convert	script.py	The Excel data is turned into .lr (text/CSV) format.
API Call	Watcher sends data	HTTP POST	The script sends the .lr content to the Database API.
Upload	API writes to DB	SQL / INSERT	The data is permanently saved in the database tables.
Next file	Waits for response for API call 	HTTP Response Object	Watcher gets the API response and receives a "Success" (HTTP 200) from DB
it moves to the next file
